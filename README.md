## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

In this project, I used SCSS/SASS for the first time!


### Continued development

I am in the "advanced CSS techniques" learning path. I will continue working on the path.

### Useful resources

- [Sass cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/sass) - I found this cheatsheet useful for a quick reference on SASS's main features.
